This mod splits weather and time properties across dimensions, so that different dimensions can have a different time/weather.

In vanilla Minecraft, all dimensions share the same weather and time settings. The only other dimensions in vanilla,
the nether and the end, don't have visual time or weather, so usually this is not noticed. However, when other dimensions
with visible weather and time are added through datapacks or mods, this can start becoming a problem, especially when mods
like [Custom Time Cycle](https://modrinth.com/mod/customtimecycle) are used as well.

This mod fixes these issues by making weather and time properties stored separately for each dimension.

Please note! When using this mod with an existing world, the time values for all dimensions except the overworld will reset
to 0. When removing the mod, the time values for all dimensions will turn back to that of the overworld.

I try to keep support up for the latest major and latest minor release of Minecraft. Updates to newer Minecraft
versions may be delayed from time to time, as I do not always have the time to immediately update my mods.

Unsupported versions are still available to download, but they won't receive new features or bugfixes.

## Usage

Mod builds can be found on the releases page, as well as on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dimension-level-data).

The Fabric API is required. This mod is not required on clients.
